                <h4>
                    Strategic Outcome 5.1: <br/><br/>Increase Denton Municipal Electric’s (DME) renewable energy portfolio from 40 to 70 percent by 2019.
                </h4>
                    <p>
                        <b>Decrease in municipal energy usage:</b><br/>
                    The City is legislatively required to reduce the amount of municipal energy used. The metric also measures how efficiently the City uses energy. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 5 percent.
                    </p><p>
                    <b>Percentage of non-solar energy rebate funding used from base amount:</b><br/>
                    Energy rebates are provided as an incentive for energy-efficiency improvements and conservation. Improving energy efficiency and conservation can help reduce peak-loading factors, which reduces burdens on energy generation and delivery systems during times of peak demand. The program also helps develop positive community relationships. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 100 percent.
                    </p><p>
                    <b>Percentage of solar energy rebate funding used from base amount:</b><br/>
                    The program provides incentives to install small-scale distributed energy generation systems. The use of small-scale energy generation systems can help reduce peak-loading factors, which reduces the burden on energy generation and delivery systems during times of peak demand. The program also helps develop positive community relationships. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 100 percent.
                    </p><p>
                    <b>Percentage of City facilities with renewable energy usage:</b><br/>
                    Denton is a leader in providing renewable energy to customers. The amount of renewable energy used by City facilities demonstrates Denton’s commitment to using renewable energy. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 70 percent.
                    </p><h4>


                    Strategic Outcome 5.2: <br/><br/>Increase percentage of landfill waste diverted from 36 to 40 percent by 2020.
                    </h4><p>
                    <b>Pounds of waste disposed per capita:</b><br/>
                    Americans produce more waste/capita than other developed countries. Denton wishes to reduce its amount of waste generated through public education and outreach programs. This measure will provide a gauge on the community’s success on reducing its waste/capita. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 1,900 pounds of waste per capita.
                    </p><p>
                    <b>Percentage of waste diverted from the landfill:</b><br/>
                    The City Council has established a goal of diverting 40 percent of the community’s waste from landfill disposal. This measure tracks the community’s and the City’s success in waste diversion and recycling programs toward reaching this goal. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 40 percent.


                    </p>
                <h4>Strategic Outcome 5.3: <br/><br/>Increase Denton’s bike and pedestrian mode share from 4.7 to 7 percent of total commuters by 2020.</h4>
                    <p>
                    <b>Number of Active Transportation safety and education activities, events, and initiatives:</b><br/>
                    Communication and presence in the community increases the number of people who will potentially choose to use active transportation methods. This creates a healthy, sustainable, active, and involved community and contributes to an increase in mode share for active transportation. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 12 events.
                    </p><p>
                    <b>Number of Active Transportation promotional events:</b><br/>
                    By directly engaging with the community through promotional events, the City can increase awareness of Active Transportation, provide education and resources, and ultimately change behaviors of road users. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 10 events.
                    </p><p>
                    <b>Number of centerline miles of on-street bike infrastructure, such as bike lanes and sharrows:</b><br/>
                    This shows that we are committed to active transportation and transit choices. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 7 miles.
                    </p><p>
                    <b>Number of trail and bikeway network gaps removed:</b><br/>
                    The Bicycle and Pedestrian plan was adopted in 2012. This measure reports our progress towards implementation and shows our commitment to active transportation and transit choice. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 4 gaps removed.
                    </p><p>
                    <b>Number of sidewalk disconnects/gaps removed:</b><br/>
                    The Bicycle and Pedestrian plan was adopted in 2012. This measure reports our progress towards implementation and shows our commitment to active transportation and transit choices. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 4 gaps removed.
                    </p><p>
                    <b>Number of transit stops with improved pedestrian and bicycle access:</b><br/>
                    The Bicycle and Pedestrian plan was adopted in 2012. This measure reports our progress towards implementation and shows our commitment to active transportation and transit choices. Our target for FY 2016-17 is 8 stops.
